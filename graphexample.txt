You need to replace enterprise-application-id with the ID of the enterprise application you're delegating from, and delegated-permission-id-for-user_impersonation with the specific ID of the user_impersonation permission for that application. This ID can be found in the enterprise application's manifest or by querying the Microsoft Graph API for the application's permissions.
